# Soccer Match Predictor

A supervised machine learning model which predicts the outcomes of future soccer matches using in-game statistics data obtained from historical games

This machine learning model leverages over 600 games played over the course of the last 2 seasons in the German football league to make accurate predictions about future match-ups.

Historical statistics such as Shots, Shots on Target, Free Kicks, Penalties, etc. are taken into account when making predictions. Furthermore, team form is also incorporated into the calculations, as well as rolling averages of each statistic from the last 3 games to better reflect the momentum each team is carrying into the next match.
